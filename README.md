The atom interaction-based coarse-grained (AICG2+) model is a residue-level structural model 
with interactions optimized using a multiscale strategy, designed to capture the funnel-shaped 
energy landscape of protein folding. 

OpenAICG2 is a Python package for running the AICG2+ model. It is integrated with OpenMM, a GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation engine, allowing it to execute on both CPU and GPU platforms. This enables efficient simulations and supports advanced sampling techniques. To learn more about openAICG2, please read the documentations at https://openaicg2.readthedocs.io/
