Welcome to openMICRON's documentation!
=========================================

The openMICRON Python package is developed on OpenMM, a GPU-accelerated molecular simulation engine, specifically for executing the AICG2+ (atom interaction-based coarse-grained) model. The AICG2+ model is a coarse-grained protein model constructed by Wenfei Li and others.
It is capable of describing biological processes such as protein folding and enzyme catalysis. Users can quickly create  AICG2+ models  using the API provided by this package.
